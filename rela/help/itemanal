_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function enables the user to evaluate the functioning of two
     or more items as a  coherent scale. Among the traditionally used
     Cronbach's Alpha the function also produces standardized estimates
      as well as Duhachek and Iacobucci's (2004) proposed standrad
     errors and respective confidence intervals for the reliability
     coefficients. Further, the function provides a bootstrap estimate
     of the convidance interval of both  the regular and standardized
     alpha values. The function's output can be used to produce three
     plots:  A density plot of the alpha and standardized alpha
     bootstrap simulations, a line plot of the "if item deleted"  alpha
     values by each item and a star plot for all of the items for their
     respective "if item deleted" scale values.  These plots can be
     called by submitting the output object of the function to the
     plot() statement. Similarly, the output can be viewed in an
     abbreviated form by submitting the output object to the summary()
     function.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     itemanal(object, SE.par = 1.96, boots = 1000)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: Numeric dataset (usually a coerced matrix from a prior data
          frame) containing all items of the scale. The dataset is
          arranged observations (rows) by measure items (columns). 

  SE.par: Confidence interval corresponding Z-score. By default set to
          the 95 % confidence interval Z-score of 1.96. 

   boots: Number of boot strap samples computed. By default 1,000
          simulations are estimated. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The function is sensitive to the how the dataset was compiled.
     Using the cbind function will often return a matirx that appears
     numeric but in reality functions as a numeric compiled list. If
     system error messages occur try transforming the dataset using
     as.matrix(data.frame(your.dataset)).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Output consists of a list with the following values:

Variables: General information about the entered items such as item
          type, number of cases used in the analysis, minimum, maximum
          values and item sum. 

Tendency: Contains the measures of central tendancy: The respective
          item mean, median, standard deviation (SD), standard error of
          the mean (SE.mean) , lower and upper values of a 95 %
          confidence interval of the mean and item variance. 

Skewness: Skewness, standard error of the skew, lower and upper values
          of the skew. 

Kurtosis: Kurtosis, standard error of kurtosis as well as its
          respective 95 % confidence interval values. 

Covariance: The covariance matrix of all items in the dataset. 

Correlation: The correlation matrix of all submitted items. 

   Alpha: The number of items in the scale as well as the covariance
          based Cronbach's alpha estimate. 

Conf.Alpha: Standard error of Cronbach's alpha with the associated
          lower and upper bound confidence interval values. 

Bootstrap.Simmulations: The regular (covariance based) alpha bootstrap
          simulated estimates. 

Alpha.Bootstrap: Bootstrap mean, standard error and confidence interval
          lower and upper limits. 

Std.Alpha: The number of items in the scale as well as the correlation
          based Cronbach's alpha estimate. 

Conf.Std.Alpha: Standard error of the standardized Cronbach's alpha
          with the associated lower and upper bound confidence interval
          values. 

Bootstrap.Std.Simmulations: The standardized (correlation based) alpha
          bootstrap simulated estimates. 

Alpha.Std.Bootstrap: Standardized bootstrap mean, standard error and
          confidence interval lower and upper limits. 

Scale.Stats: Changes in scale statistics upon deletion of any one item
          in the scale. Contains scale mean and variance. 

Alpha.Stats: Changes in the scale's reliability estimate alpha upon
          deletion of any one item. Contains, corrected total item
          correlation, squared multiple correlation, adjusted alpha
          statistic without given item. 

    call: Submitted function call. 

_N_o_t_e:

     Under the current version of this function/package missing data is
     deleted listwise. Consequently only full cases are used in
     determining scale reliability. Also, note that the legends for the
     plots are placed interactively.  Furthermore, the default plot
     function for the itemanal() object uses a windows() statement to
     produce several  plots. This prevents prior plots from being
     replaced at the same time allowing for numerous plots to be
     produced. However, this option may not be fully functional in MAC
     and Linux environemnts since the function calls on a windows
     metafile.
