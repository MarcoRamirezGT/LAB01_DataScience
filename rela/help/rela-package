     The package's functions analyze scale items as a collective
     measure  providing information both on the item and scale level.
     Cronbach's reliability estimates are reported both in the original
     and standardized form along with respective standard  errors and
     confidence interval lower and upper bounds. Further the principal
     axis factoring  function (paf) included in the package allows to
     preliminarily screen the items if they load on the same single
     latent construct. Both functions' output can be viewed abbreviated
     using summary() as well as in graphical form using plot().
